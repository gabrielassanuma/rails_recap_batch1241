## Rails Recap Class - Batch 1241


## Create local setup

Inside your code folder:

```bash
  mkdir rails_recap_batch1241
  cd rails_recap_batch1241
```

Set up Le Wagon minimal rails template:
```bash
  rails new \
  -d postgresql \
  -j webpack \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/rails-templates/master/minimal.rb \
  rails_recap_batch1241
```

Create repo and push it to github:
```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "First commit"
  gh repo create --public --source=.
  git push origin main
```

Your can check your repo on browser with this command on terminal:
```bash
  gh repo view --web
```

## Model

We NEVER üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è work on MASTER!üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Create a branch before move on:
```bash
  git checkout -b model-creation
```

Create model Post:
```bash
  rails g model Post title content
```
Create db and migrate:
```bash
  rails db:create
  rails db:migrate
```

Let's create some posts on our seed file

Start by including faker in your Gemfile:
```bash
   gem 'faker'
```

Run bundle install:
```bash
   bundle install
```

On your seed.rd:
```bash
  require 'faker'

  puts "Dropping data..."
  Post.destroy_all
  puts "Creating new seed"
  5.times do | index |
    puts "creating #{index + 1} Post"
    Post.create(title: Faker::Book.title, content: Faker::Lorem.paragraph)
    puts "#{index + 1} Post created!"
  end
```

Run rails db:seed:
```bash
  rails db:seed
```

Check Posts on console:
```bash
   rails console
```

Push changes to github:
```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "created post model, generated db, add faker gem add seeds to post"
   git push origin model-creation 
```

## Action Index Posts (show all)

Always remember...
We NEVER üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è work on MASTER!üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Create a branch before move on
```bash
  git checkout -b index-posts
```

Create Posts controller
```bash
   rails g controller posts
```

Do you remember this pattern?
route ‚û°Ô∏è controller#action ‚û° view
Here we go again! üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

In your config folder open routes.rb add the path for our first action, index will be our root path also.
```bash
   root "posts#index"
   get "/posts", to: "posts#index"
```

Go to app/controllers/posts and add index function:
```bash
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
```

Go to app/views/posts and create file index.html.erb and copy this code:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col6 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <h1>I LOVE RAILS ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cards">
      <% @posts.each do | post | %>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-header">
            <%= "Card for post - #{post.id}" %>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title"><%= post.title %></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><%= post.content %></p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-light">Go somewhere</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Go to app/assets/stylesheets create one posts folder, inside it create one file index.sccs and copy this code:
```bash
  .cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 18px;
}
```

Don't forget to import it to application.scss ‚§µÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è
```bash
  @import "posts/index";
```

Push changes to github:
```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "created posts controller, add index to routes, set index#posts to root, created index posts file added index.sccs"
   git push origin index-posts
```
## Action Show

Create a branch before move on
```bash
  git checkout -b show-post
```

Add route for show action, using resources
```bash
 resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
```

Time to implement action on controller:
```bash
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
```

Go to app/views/posts and create file show.html.erb and copy this code:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-header">
            One post
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title"><%= @post.title %></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><%= @post.content %></p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-footer text-muted">
            I ‚ù§Ô∏è rails!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Push changes to github:
```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "added show to routes, set show#posts and created view show"
   git push origin show-posts
```


## Action Create

Create a branch before move on:
```bash
  git checkout -b create-posts
```

Add new route to router.rb:
```bash
  resources :posts, only: [:index,:new, :create, :show]
```

Go to app/controllers/posts and add function:
```bash
  def new
    @post = Post.new
  end
```

Go to app/views/posts and create file new.html.erb and copy this code:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="w-60 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <%= simple_form_for(@post) do |f| %>
          <%= f.input :title %>
          <%= f.input :content %>
          <%= f.submit %>
        <% end %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Let's go back to post controller and add create function:
```bash
  def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    if @post.save
      redirect_to root_path
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```

Time to set-up parameters coming from the view:
```bash
  private 

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title, :content)
  end
```

Push changes to github:
```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "created new and create function on post controller, set view for new post, added strong parametes, routes for new and create"
  git push origin create-posts
```

## Action Edit 

Create a branch before move on:
```bash
  git checkout -b edit-posts
```

Add new route to router.rb:
```bash
  resources :posts, only: [:index,:new, :create, :show, :edit]
```

Go to app/controllers/posts and add function:
```bash
  def edit
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
 ```
 
Go to app/views/posts and create file edit.html.erb, as we will use the same form from new.html.erb, let's apply DRY and render the form.
Create inside app/views/posts one file _form.html.erb and insert our simple form:
```bash
  <%= simple_form_for(@post) do |f| %>
    <%= f.input :title %>
    <%= f.input :content %>
    <%= f.submit %>
  <% end %>
```

Now go back to edit.html.erb and paste it:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="w-60 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <%= render "form", post: @post %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
 ```
 
 Don't forget to change new.html.erb file using our _form rener
 
 Time to come back to controller and create update function:
```bash
    def update
      @post = Post.find(params[:id])
      if @post.update(post_params)
        redirect_to root_path
      else
        render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
      end
    end
```

Push changes to github:
```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "added update routes, included edit and update functions on post controller, applied DRY to post simple form, changed new.html.erb, added edit.html.erb"
  git push origin edit-posts
```

## Time to play with nested action, let's add reviews to our posts

## Generate review model

Create a new branch:
```bash
  git checkout add-review-to-post
```

On your terminal:
```bash
  rails generate model Review content:text post:references
```

Set relationship between review and post models:
```bash
 class Post < ApplicationRecord
   has_many :reviews, dependent: :destroy
 end
```
```bash
  class Review < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :post
  end
```

## Action new review

On router.rb:
```bash
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root "posts#index"
    resources :posts, only: [:index, :new, :create, :show, :edit, :update] do
      resources :reviews, only: [:new, :create]
    end
end
end
```

Generate Review Controller on terminal:
```bash
  rails g controller reviews new
```

On your review controller add the function:
```bash
  def new
    @Post = Post.find(params[:post_id])
    @review = Review.new
  end
```

Go to app/views/reviews and create file new.html.erb and copy this code:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="w-60 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <%= simple_form_for [@post, @review] do |f| %>
          <%= f.input :content %>
          <%= f.submit "Submit review" %>
        <% end %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

And go back to the controller and set function create and strong params:
```bash
   def create
    @post = Post.find(params[:post_id])
    @review = Review.new(review_params)
    @review.post = @post
    if @review.save
      redirect_to post_path(@post)
    else 
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def review_params
    params.require(:review).permit(:content)
  end
```

Change show view for this:
```bash
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 my-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-header">
            One post
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title"><%= @post.title %></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><%= @post.content %></p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-footer text-muted">
            I ‚ù§Ô∏è rails!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="w-10 d-flex justify-content-between">
        <%= link_to "Add new review", new_post_review_path(@post), class: "btn btn-light" %>
        <%= link_to "Back to index", root_path, class: "btn btn-light" %>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 justify-content-center mt-5">
        <p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <% @post.reviews.each do |review| %>
            <li class="list-group-item"><%= review.content %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

## Final touch
Replace seed.rb
```bash
    require 'faker'

  puts "Dropping data..."
    Post.destroy_all
    puts "Creating new seed"
